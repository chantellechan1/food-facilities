# Food Facilities Challenge

## Overview

- explain problem and solution

## Get Started

## Architecture choices

- grouped code modularly (by domain) as in past projects I've found this approach to be more maintainable over time and faster for onboarding new team members
- Note that instead of using the `/src` directory as is typical, all backend code is placed in `/api` as is default for vercel express apps.

## Critque

- What would you have done differently if you had spent more time on this?
- What are the trade-offs you might have made?
- What are the things you left out?
- What are the problems with your implementation and how would you solve them if we had to scale the application to a large number of users?
